# List-Maker-Pro
A list making application to simplify and shorten our list making process at work.

At work we have to make about a dozen different lists everyday.
This project is simple solution to that problem.
It will be a single file containing the html css and javascript that I can put on my computer at work.
There will be no ajax calls or persistence, to hopefully my IT department will not consider it a security risk.

This repository contains source code for a generic version that can be customized to any line and assembled into a sigle file.
